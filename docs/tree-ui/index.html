						Setting up is easy and intuitive, and it takes no time.<br>
						To start, download and import the asset<br>
						In the assets folder, you will see a new folder called "StefaiGames", which holds all the data linked to this asset<br>
						<br>
						Now, we can start with creating the menu system<br>
						</p><br>
						<h1><strong>Creating the Menu Network</strong></h1>
						<p>
						Right-click in Hierarchy: <code>GameObject -> UI -> TreeUI -> Menu Network</code><br>.
						You will see this structure in your hierarchy:<br>
						<img src="Images/ss1.png" alt="tree-ui-hierarchy"><br>
						Where:<br>
						<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-300">
						<li><strong>Canvas</strong> - Root object of the entire UI</li>
						<li><strong>MenuManager</strong> - Root object of all the menus</li>
						<li><strong>Transitions</strong> - Root object of all the transitions</li>
						</ul>
						</p><br>
						<h1><b>Creating A Menu</b></h1>
						<p>
						Creating a menu is as easy as right click in the Hierarchy: <code>GameObject -> UI -> TreeUI -> Menu</code><br>
						This opens a setup window, which looks like this:
						<img src="Images/ss2.png" alt="menu-setup-wizard"><br>
						Where:
						<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-300">
						<li><strong>Menu Preset</strong> - Prefab of the menu. Leave empty if creating the menu from scratch</li>
						<li><strong>Object Name</strong> - Name of the object in the scene. Defaulting to "New Menu"</li>
						<li><strong>Menu Name</strong> - Name of the menu, used in the seach algorythm. Defaulting to object name, if both are empty, default is "NewMenu"</li>
						</ul><br>
						Once you setup the menu, click on "Create Menu" to finish it. This will create the Menu object in the hierachy<br><br>
						
						<strong>Note</strong>: selected scene object matters. There are 3 cases:
						<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-300">
						<li>if no object is selected, the menu will be created as the child object of the MenuManager</li>
						<li>if the MenuManager or another menu is selected, the menu will be created as the child object of the selected object</li>
						<li>any other case, the menu will be created as the child object of the selected object</li>
						</ul><br>
						Let's talk about how the search algorithm works. There are 2 main functions that are used throughout the system:<br>
						<code>MenuManager -> OpenMenu(string menuPath)</code> and <br>
						<code>MenuManager -> TransitionToMenu(string menuPath)</code><br>
						<br>
						The <code>menuPath</code> variable functions like a folder path, <br>
						where each menu name is separated by a splitter character (defined in the MenuManager inspector, default <code>'/'</code>)<br>
						example: <code>mainMenu/optionsMenu</code>

					Transitions are a very powerful tool, which allows users to esthetically boost the opening of the menus.<br>
					The Transitions are <strong>Animator</strong> based, which allows for full customizability of them. <br>
					
					Let's start by creating a transition object:<br>
					Right click on the hierarchy, and open <code>GameObject -> UI -> TreeUI -> Transition</code><br>
					This will open a setup wizard for the transitions, which looks like this:
					<img src="Images/ss3.png" alt="transition-wizard"><br>
					where:<br><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-300">
					<li><strong>Transition Preset</strong> - prefab of the transition. Useful if you already created a transition that you want to use</li>
					<li><strong>Object Name</strong> - Name of the transition scene object</li>
					</ul>
					Within the object, you will have the <code>Transition</code> component, along with the <code>Animator</code> component.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Scene Setup</strong><br>
					Add a child <strong>Panel</strong> object to the transition you just created by right clicking on the tansition object in the scene, and selecting <code>UI -> Panel</code>, and name it "<strong>Background</strong>" for example<br>
					When that's done, you're ready to start with the animator setup.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Animator setup</strong><br>
					Create the animator controller by right clicking in the project folder, and select <code>Create -> Animation -> Animator Controller</code><br>
					While you're there, create the animation clip for the transition, by selecting <code>Create -> Animation -> Animation Clip</code><br>
					Link the animator controller to the transition you just created by dragging it into the animator controller field within the Animator on the transition object<br>
					In this example, we will create a fade transition, which is already included in the demos, so you can view the setup if you need more details.<br>
					<br>
					Double click on the newly created Animator controller, which will open the <strong>Animator</strong> window.<br>
					Now, in that window, right click -> <code>Create state -> Empty</code>. This state is going to be the idle state.<br>
					Best practice is to name it "<strong>Idle</strong>". You set that at the top of the inspector, when that state is selected.<br>
					At this point, the animator should look like this:<br>
					<img src="Images/ss4.png" alt="Example-Animator-1"><br>
					Now, open the parameters section at the top left, and add a <strong>trigger</strong> parameter called "<strong>StartTransition</strong>"<br>
					You do that by clicking the "+" icon at top left section, and selecting <code>Trigger</code>.<br>
					<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: this is case sensitive. Make sure that the name is exactly the same, including the uppercase and lowercase letters.<br>
					Now, we can create the animation itself.<br>
					<br>
					Now, we can head back to the project folder, where you can create the animation clip by right click -> <code>Create -> Animation -> Animation Clip</code><br>
					Drag that newly created animation clip into the animator window, where it will pop up as a new block.<br> 
					Now, right click on the <strong>Idle</strong> block, and select <code>Make Transition</code>, and then click the newly added animation block to link them.<br>
					Do the same in the opposite way: right click on the animation, <code>Make Transition</code>, and click on the idle animation. With that, you created the transition loop.<br>
					At this point, the animator should look something like this:<br>
					<img src="Images/ss10.png" alt="Example-Animator-2">
					The idea is this: Idle animation runs most of the time on loop, up until we trigger the <strong>StartTransition</strong> trigger, <br>
					at which point the transition clip will play, and then return to <strong>Idle</strong> state.<BR>
					Now, let's setup the transitions themselves. Select the transition from the <strong>Idle</strong> state to the transition animation (indicated by the arrow direction), and add the condition.<br>
					Unity will automatically set it to the StartTransition trigger we created, because it's the only parameter we currently have.<br>
					Now, we can start setting up the look of the transition<br>
					<br>
					<strong>Animation Config</strong><br>
					Double click the newly created clip to open the <strong>Animation</strong> window.<br>
					Now, we can setup the animation flow.<br>
					Since the animator is setup, we can just select the transition object in the scene, and the animation will be automatically opened.<br>
					We can click on the "<strong>Record</strong>" button, which allows you to automatically create animation keyframes while you're editing the oject.<br>
					After adding a few keyframes (which you will see later how it should look), you have to decide at which frame the menu should open.<br>
					When you decide, set the time to that frame, and add an animation event (left side of the animation window, the icon looks like a shield).<br>
					That will create the event, and open it's view in the inspector. Set the function to <code>Transition -> Methods -> OpenMenu</code><br>
					When all that's done, the animation should look like this:<br>
					<img src="Images/ss11.png" alt="Example-Animation-1"><br>
					Where:<br>
					<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-300">
					<li><strong>Beginning</strong> - the panel is fully transparent</li>
					<li><strong>Middle</strong> - the panel is fully opaque, and the menu opens (visible at the top, with a shield icon)</li>
					<li><strong>End</strong> - the panel is fully transparent again</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<p>
					This asset supports 3 different workflows: <br>
					<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-300">
					<li><strong>Script based</strong> - allows for controlling the system through scripts</li>
					<li><strong>Event based</strong> - allows for controlling the system through events</li>
					<li><strong>Visual Scripting</strong> - complete visual scripting integration</li>
					</ul><br>
					<strong>note</strong>: all 3 interaction workflows are created to be equally powerful, utlizing overload functions for futher ease of use<br>
					<br>
					let's break down each workflow individually:<br>
					<br>
					<h1><strong>1. Script based workflow</strong></h1><br>
					Let's explain this workflow with an example of the pause menu. <br>
					Create the menu architecture that looks like this:<br>
					<img src="Images/ss5.png" alt="example-architecture-1">
					<br>
					Now, with this setup, we can start creating the <strong>logic</strong>.<br>
					Create a script called <code>UIManager</code><br>
					In the script, add the following code to the Update function:<br>
					<code><pre>if(Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Escape))
{
    MenuManager.Instance.OpenMenu(
		MenuManager.Instance.GetMenu("gameMenu/pauseMenu").isOpen ? 
		"gameMenu" : 
		"gameMenu/pauseMenu");
}</pre></code>
					What's happening? <br>
					<code>MenuManager.Instance.GetMenu</code> function returns a reference to the menu. <br>
					<code>isOpen</code> is a boolean which returns the state of the menu, IE. Is it open or closed. <br>
					<code>MenuManager.OpenMenu</code> is a function which opens a menu under the specified path, and closes all the other ones.<br>
					<br>
					<strong>2. Event based workflow</strong><br>
					Let's explain this workflow with an example of a button opening the game menu.<br>
					Create the menu architecture that looks like this:<br>
					<img src="Images/ss6.png" alt="example-architecture-2"><br>
					Now, with this setup, create a button within the <code>mainMenu</code>, and name it <code>StartGameButton</code><br>
					Within the button OnClick event, add a listener. Set the MenuManager object as the target, and set the <code>MenuManager -> OpenMenu(string)</code> as the function<br>
					It should look something like this:
					<img src="Images/ss7.png" alt="example-event-setup-1">
					<br>
					For the menuPath parameter, set <code>gameMenu/base</code> where base menu is here to show the possibility of a nested architecture of the Menus.<br>
					<br>
					That's it, you can open the menu with a button. <br>
					<br>
					Now, let's say you want to use a transition instead of plain opening of the menus. You can easily do that by adding a listener before the one we added.<br>
					All the functions come from the MenuManager script, and the first function called should be <code>MenuManager -> SetTargetTransition(int)</code><br>
					Set the index to 0<br>
					The second function will be <code>MenuManager -> TransitionToMenu(string)</code>. Set the parameter to <code>gameMenu/base</code>.<br>
					After that's done, you need to add the transition to the Transitions list. In our example, we will use the included <strong>Fade</strong> transition.<br>
					Right click in the hierarchy, <code>UI -> TreeUI -> Transition</code>. <br>
					For the transition Preset, drag and drop the <strong>Fade Transition</strong> prefab found in the <code>StefaiGames/TreeUI/demos/Transitions/Fade</code><br>
					After finishing up the transition setup, you are good to go. The transition will trigger as wanted.
					<br><br>
					<strong>3. Visual Scripting</strong><br>
					Before setting up our script graphs, make sure to import the <strong>StefaiGames assembly definition</strong> into the <code>edit -> project settings -> visual scripting -> Node library</code>, and click on "<strong>Regenerate Nodes</strong>"<br>
					After doing this, you're ready to interact with the menu system. <br>
					<br>
					We will use the same example of the <strong>pause menu</strong> opening logic. <br>
					We will need the same hierarchy as in the first example, it should look like this:<br>
					<img src="Images/ss5.png" alt="example-arcitecture-3"><br>
					Once that's done, add a component <code>Script Machine</code> to the Canvas object.<br>
					within that component, click the "<strong>New</strong>" button. This will open the folder view, allowing you to save the script graph to the desired location<br>
					Open that script graph by clicking on the field next to the button you just clicked.<br>
					Now, let's create the logic. First let's add the variable for the menu manager. On the right, you will see the variables tab. Select the object variables, and add one called <strong>MenuManager</strong><br>
					For the type, select <code>StefaiGames -> TreeUI -> MenuSystem -> MenuManager</code><br>
					For the value of the variable, drag the <code>MenuManager</code> object into the field<br>
					Now, we are ready to create the actual node setup. It should look something like this:<br>
					<img src="Images/ss8.png" alt="example-node-setup-1"><br>
					Now, I know this looks like a lot, but let's explain what each part does:<br>
					<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-300">
					<li><code>On Update</code> - this is the node that kickstarts the chain. It's telling the engine to run this node tree every frame</li>
					<li><code>On Update -> Get Menu -> isOpen</code> - this flow allows us to access the state of the menu, IE, is it open<br> 
					The <code>GetMenu</code> node returns the Menu object, while the <code>isOpen</code> node returns it's state</li>
					<li><code>if node</code> - allows us to split the logic depending on the state of the menu.</li>
					<li><code>Open Menu</code> - opens the actual menu. We have 2 <code>Open Menu</code> nodes, which fire depending on what state the menu is in</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

				<strong>Menu Manager</strong> script handles the menus on a global level, and is attached to the root object of all the Menus. <br>
				This script is a singleton, meaning that there <strong>must</strong> be only a single instance of this script in the entire project.<br>
				<br>
				Let's first look at the inspector of this script, which looks like this:<br>
				<img src="Images/ss9.png" alt="menu-manager-inspector"><br>
				Where:
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-300">
				<li><strong>Transitions</strong> - list of all the transitions, in the function <code>SetTargetTransition(int index)</code>, the index refers to the placement within this list</li>
				<li><strong>Max History Length</strong> - integer, maximum count of menus opened which the history keeps track of. Used for the function <code>OpenLastMenu()</code></li>
				<li><strong>Splitter</strong> - character used to parse the menu names from the menu path. Defaulted to <code>'/'</code> and is used in the <code>OpenMenu(string menuPath)</code></li>
				</ul><br>
				Now, let's get to the functions:<br>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-300">
				<li><code>OpenMenu(string menuPath)</code> [return type: <strong>void</strong>] -<br> Closes all the menus, and opens the one under the specified path</li>
				<li><code>OpenLastMenu()</code> [return type: <strong>void</strong>] - <br>Closes all the menus, and opens the last menu in history</li>
				<li><code>TransitionToMenu(string menuPath)</code> [return type: <strong>void</strong>] - <br>triggers the transition animation. Used in pair with the <code>SetTargetTransition(int index)</code> to define the target transition. This overload exists for event friendliness</li>
				<li><code>TransitionToMenu(string menuPath, int transitionIndex)</code> [return type: <strong>void</strong>] - <br>triggers the transition animation.</li>
				<li><code>LoadSceneSingle(int buildIndex)</code> [return type: <strong>void</strong>] - <br>loads the scene under the specified build index in the singular scene loading mode</li>
				<li><code>LoadSceneAdditive(int buildIndex)</code> [return type: <strong>void</strong>] - <br>loads the scene under the specified build index in the additive scene loading mode</li>
				<li><code>LoadSceneSingle(string sceneName)</code> [return type: <strong>void</strong>] - <br>loads the scene under the specified scene name in the singular scene loading mode</li>
				<li><code>LoadSceneAdditive(string sceneName)</code> [return type: <strong>void</strong>] - <br>loads the scene under the specified scene name in the additive scene loading mode</li>
				<li><code>GetMenu(string menuPath)</code> [return type: <strong>Menu</strong>] - <br>returns the menu under the specified path</li>
				</ul><br>
				<br>
				for event based interactions, this asset includes some helper functions that bypass the unity's current one-parameter limitation for event listeners:
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-300">
				<li><code>SetTargetTransition(int transitionIndex)</code> [return type: <strong>void</strong>] - <br>sets the target transition. Used for inspector events</li>
				<li><code>SetTargetScene(int targetBuildIndex)</code> [return type: <strong>void</strong>] - <br>sets the target scene for the next menu opening, under the specified build index. <strong>NOTE:</strong> make sure that the scene is added to the <code>file -> build settings</code>!</li>
				<li><code>SetTargetScene(string sceneName)</code> [return type: <strong>void</strong>] - <br>sets the target scene for the next menu opening, under the specified scene name. <strong>NOTE:</strong> make sure that the scene is added to the <code>file -> build settings</code>!</li>
				<li><code>SetTransitionLoadSceneMode(LoadSceneMode mode)</code> [return type: <strong>void</strong>] - <br>sets the target scene loading mode for the next menu opening, under the specified mode</li>
				</ul>
				</p>

						<strong>Menu</strong> script is attached to every Menu object. It handles the menu opening and closing on a local level.<br>
						It also contains it's submenus, which allows for infinitely deep menu structures.<br>
						Every <strong>Menu</strong> should be a child object of the <strong>MenuManager</strong> or another <strong>Menu</strong><br>
						When talking about the inspector, it looks like this:<br>
						<img src="Images/ss12.png" alt="menu-inspector"><br>
						where:<br>
						<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-300">
						<li><strong>Menu Name</strong> - sting, name of the menu, which is used in the search algorithm</li>
						<li><strong>On Menu Open</strong> - unity event, which allows for custom behaviour when this menu is opened</li>
						<li><strong>On Menu Close</strong> - unity event, which allows for custom behaviour when this menu is closed</li>
						</ul><br>
						When talking about public functions, there is only 1, and that's:<br>
						<code>RenameMenu(string newName)</code> - renames the menu, and updates the internal Dictionary's reference.<br>
						<strong>Note</strong>: the RenameMenu function is only needed for runtime updates through script.<br>
						When updating the menu name through the inspector, the internal dictionaries are handled by a custom inspector.

					As this is a complex system, the entire menu system is covered with custom error messages.<br>
					Those messages would not only tell you that something is wrong, but explain to you how to fix it.<br>
					Let's break them down one by one:<br>
					<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-sm text-slate-300">
					<li><code>There is no menu network to search through!</code><br>
					<strong>Cause</strong>: Trying to ping/open a menu from the inspector before the menu network is created.<br>
					</li>
					<li> message: <code>There is already a menu network in the project, you must have only one in the entire project</code><br>
					<strong>Cause</strong>: trying to create a second instance of the menu manager.<br>
					<strong>Reason</strong>: MenuManager is a singleton, and thus there must be only 1 instance of it in the entire project<br>
					To allow for scene handling, the system moves the entire <strong>Menu network</strong> into the <code>DontDestroyOnLoad</code><br>
					Which persists over scene loads.
					</li>
					<li>
					<code>There is no subMenu of {menu parent} that bears the menu name {menu name}</code><br>
					<strong>Cause</strong>: The search algorithm found no matches to the needed menu<br>
					<strong>Reason</strong>: There are multiple possibilities, you either didn't create that menu yet, or you misspelt the menu name.<br>
					The fuzzy search prevents minor spelling errors, but for larger mistakes, it can't compensate.<br>
					Another reason can be that you put the menu into the wrong layer, or you mixed up the layers.<br>
					<strong>Fix</strong> Find the action which called the OpenMenu function, and update the menu path
					</li>
					<li>
					<code>There is no menu {current menu name} in the menu manager list, did you mean {closest match}? If so, please spell the menu name correctly in the function which tried to open this menu</code><br>
					<strong>Cause</strong>: search algorithm didn't find any exact matches, but the fuzzy search found a close match.<br>
					<strong>Reason</strong>: As previously stated, there can be multiple reasons: misspelt menu name is the most common one.<br>
					<strong>Fix</strong>: Find the function call, and update the spelling on the menu
					</li>
					<li>
					<code>There is no menu {Menu Name} and we couldn't find the closest match, please check that you input the correct naming order, and that you spelled the name correctly!</code><br>
					<strong>Cause</strong>: search algorithm didn't find any exact matches, and the fuzzy search wasn't able to compensate<br>
					<strong>Reason</strong>: As previously stated, multiple reasons exist: misspelt menu name, missed layer, you didn't create the menu yet, etc.<br>
					<strong>Fix</strong>: Find out which of the reasons was the problem, and fix them (either creating the wanted menu or updating the menu path in the function call)<br>
					</li>
					<li>
					<code>the transition is not setup correctly. Please add the trigger parameter called 'StartTransition'</code><br>
					<strong>Cause</strong>: the "<strong>StartTransition</strong>" parameter in the target transition wasn't setup.
					<strong>Reason</strong>: You didn't follow the steps for transition setup outlined in the <strong>section 03</strong>.<br>
					<strong>Fix</strong>: Add the parameter "<strong>StartTransition</strong>". Check out the <strong>Section 03</strong> for details
					</li>
					<li>
					<code>Duplicate menu name detected on the same branch. '{originalName}' was renamed to '{menuName}'.</code><br>
					<strong>Cause</strong>: When renaming the menu, there was already one in the same layer with the same name.<br>
					<strong>Fix</strong>: No fix needed, the program automatically handled the duplication, as evident in the message.
					</li>
					<li>
					<code>A menu can't have an empty name! Renaming the menu to 'New Menu'</code><br>
					<strong>Cause</strong>: You tried to rename a menu to an empty string. That's not allowed in this system.<br>
					<strong>Fix</strong>: No fix needed, the menu was automatically renamed to "<strong>New Menu</strong>", as evident in the message
					</li>
					<li>
					<code>Every Menu must be a direct or indirect child of the menu manager!</code><br>
					<strong>Cause</strong>: moving the menu outside the MenuManager parent.<br>
					<strong>Fix</strong>: No fix needed, the system automatically reverted the reparenting of the object.
					</li>
					</ul>
